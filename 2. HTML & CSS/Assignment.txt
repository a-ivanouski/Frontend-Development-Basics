Please create a basic html5 site with following structure:
1. Main Page - page about company (name, logo, short description, address, contacts etc)
2. Products Page - page with list of 3-5 products (with thumbnail image and detailed features) produced by your company 
3. Feedback Page - page with feedback form (fields: name, e-mail or phone, feedback text, submit button to "/feedback" url)
Use html only, no css, no javascript.

You can do this task for well-known company (Apple, Amazon, E-bay etc) as well as for some fictitious company. 

Please don't forget to use semantic tags, modernizer and verify html using http://validator.w3.org/ 
Using microformat to increase page semantic would be a great plus.
